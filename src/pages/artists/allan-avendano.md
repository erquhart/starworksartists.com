At a very early age, Allan Avendaño was enamored by the glamour of old Hollywood. Thinking he may find his path in the entertainment industry, he pursued a Bachelor of Science in Communications and acquired a job in television production. Upon realizing his true interest in beauty and fashion, he switched gears and began working for a fashion magazine. Given the responsibility of booking talent for shoots, Allan assigned himself as makeup artist on an editorial job, laying the foundation for his current career.

From studying facial symmetry to extensive product research, Allan was a natural talent and fastidious student of his trade. He solidified his skills as a freelance artist for MAC Cosmetics before moving on to work with top Hollywood talent on fashion and beauty editorials, red carpet looks, fashion brand campaigns and major network television projects. In 2014, Allan was nominated for an EMMY for his work with Cat Deeley and the cast of “So You Think You Can Dance.”

One aspect of Allan’s career of which he is most proud is his work with charities. He has worked with Project Angel Food, lending his talents to their fundraising efforts, and been involved with The Chrysalis Foundation and MAC AIDS Fund. He has also spent several summers traveling to New York City to do makeup for “Broadway Bares,” a production that helps Broadway performers and celebrities raise money for Broadway Cares / Equity Fights AIDS.

Allan lives in Los Angeles.
