Kayleen McAdams’ eye for beauty, and dedication to the technicalities of makeup artistry, has led to a remarkable career in the beauty industry. Kayleen’s work is characterized by her emphasis on refined bone structure and clean, natural makeup with selective pops of color.

While studying psychology at the University of Western Ontario, Kayleen assisted in the beauty department at Flare magazine. Her interest in pursuing a career in makeup became solidified when she visited her sister Rachel on the set of “The Notebook” and saw the extraordinary work of makeup artists first-hand. After returning to Toronto, Kayleen began makeup school where she studied fashion, photography, theater, prosthetics and film. She returned to Los Angeles and quickly built an illustrious list of entertainment clientele.

Kayleen’s work has been featured in editorials for Vogue, Harper’s Bazaar, ELLE, Vanity Fair, Teen Vogue and GQ. She has contributed to advertising campaigns for top brands including Jimmy Choo, Abercrombie & Fitch, Buffalo Denim, CoverGirl and Avon. Her celebrity clients include Lily Collins, Rachel McAdams, Jessica Biel, Gal Gadot, Riley Keough, Sofia Vergara and Leighton Meester.
