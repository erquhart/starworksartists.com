A first generation Scotsman, Caile Noble was raised in Southern California. After years of traveling the world as a professional cyclist, Caile was inspired to make a change to professional hair styling. His education began at the Vidal Sassoon Academy, after which he started to work for celebrated stylist Serge Normant at the John Frieda Salon. Assisting Serge on high profile fashion editorials and campaigns soon led Caile to pursue his current career in freelance hairstyling.

Caile’s work is characterized by its innovative vision, intricate precision, and effortless style. Caile was touted as “one of the best hair stylists from New York to Los Angeles” by Allure Magazine, and his work has been featured in publications like Vogue, ELLE, Glamour, Harper’s Bazaar, Interview, L’Officiel Italia, Marie Claire, Numero, and W. Caile has worked on campaigns for brands including Givenchy, Calvin Klein, Diesel, and Nike, and he has collaborated with renowned photographers such as Mert Alas and Marcus Piggot, Briggitte Lacombe, Cedric Buchet, Regan Cameron, and Victor Demarchelier. His expertise has also been showcased as an on-camera beauty brand ambassador for Garnier and John Frieda.
