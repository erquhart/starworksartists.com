As freelance artists, Wayman worked in fashion editorial for numerous Condé Nast titles including GQ, Vanity Fair, and L’Officiel Hommes, and cultivated weekly content for The New York Times Style section, while Micah worked for major design houses including Marc Jacobs and Alice + Olivia, and consulted on ready-to-wear collections for numerous emerging designers within New York and Los Angeles. Upon combining their vision and expertise, Wayman & Micah quickly became sought-after by top Hollywood talent. Some of their most notable work can be found on the red carpet, dressing celebrities for awards season, film and television premiers and high-profile fashion events.
