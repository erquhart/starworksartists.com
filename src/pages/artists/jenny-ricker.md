A graduate of NYU’s Tisch School of the Arts, Jenny Ricker first became interested in the world of fashion styling while working as an agent for Ford Models. Ricker began by assisting some of the top fashion stylists in Los Angeles and has gone on to become one of the most sought after men’s celebrity stylists in Hollywood.

With a client list that reads like a who’s who of red carpet royalty – Zac Efron, Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Aaron Paul – Ricker is barreling quickly to the top of her game without any signs of letting up. Her work has been shot by the likes of Matt Jones, Brian Bowen Smith, Danielle Levitt & David Roemer.

Jenny’s obsession for whimsical vintage finds and combining the two sources of fashion, old and new, highlights her unique point-of-view and illustrates her imagination and creativity.
Her distinctive style has been recognized and featured on the covers of GQ, BlackBook Magazine, Rolling Stone and Men’s Health. Her background in art, film, and the modeling world has led Jenny down a multi-faceted path and her approach to styling is a direct reflection of her upbringing between Los Angeles, New York, and her many travels to Europe.
