From major fashion shows to high-profile celebrity shoots, Marcus Francis’s precision, style and inimitable expertise in creating beautiful hairstyles have made him one of the most sought-after artists in the fashion and entertainment industries.

Moving to Los Angeles from Seattle in the late 1990s, Marcus crafted his innate talent for hairstyling into a career that combines his love of fashion, Hollywood and travel. Upon completion of his cosmetology degree, Marcus pursued both cut and color at several prominent salons in West Hollywood and New York City. Marcus’s assignment career began to take shape when he created looks for branded events organized by top fashion magazines including Vogue and W. He was soon assisting the most recognized hairstylists in the fashion industry—including Guido, Sam McKnight and Orlando Pita—on photo shoots and the Fashion Week collections in New York, Milan and Paris.

Since returning to Los Angeles, Marcus has built a clientele that comprises the most influential names in Hollywood including Julianne Moore, Gwyneth Paltrow, Jennifer Connelly, Amy Adams and Lizzy Caplan. He has collaborated with leading photographers including Norman Jean Roy, Mark Seliger, David Bellemere and Max Abadian on editorial assignments for such titles as Vogue, Vanity Fair, Harper’s Bazaar, ELLE International, Glamour, Jalouse and L’Officiel. His advertising clients include The Limited, Fidelia and Neutrogena.

Marcus lives in Los Angeles.
