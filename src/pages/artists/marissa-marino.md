Marissa Marino has a true passion for the art of hairstyling. She started her career as Ken Pavesâ€™ first assistant, where she got invaluable training in everything from coloring and styling wigs to how to thrive under pressure. It is also where she gained an international perspective while traveling the the world for showcases and celebrity clients. Some of her very first clients were Eva Longoria, Jennifer Lopez, Victoria Beckham and Ashlee Simpson, to name a few. She has a knack for understanding exactly what her clients want, and delivering beyond their expectations.

In 2009, she made the decision to join Nine Zero One Salon to grow her career. Nine Zero One has been responsible for setting many trends in the hair industry and also for using social media as a way to share their work and inspire others. In 2013, Marissa joined Selena Gomez for her Stars Dance World Tour, where she styled hair for nightly shows. She has also contributed to many high profile red carpet events and editorial shoots.
