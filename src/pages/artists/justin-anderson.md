Colorist Justin Anderson was born and raised near the ocean in the sunny climate of Southern California. A surfer from childhood, he became fascinated at an early age with the ways ocean water and sun created natural highlights and lowlights in hair, giving it dimension and radiance. Upon deciding to pursue a career in hair color, he apprenticed himself to two of Hollywood’s leading blonde experts, Johnathan Gale of the Serge Normant Salon and Sheri Roman of the Art Luna Salon.

Anderson quickly graduated to his own chair at the Neil George Salon, being dubbed by Vogue as the “rising star of blonde Hollywood.” Anderson's celebrity clients include Jennifer Aniston, Miley Cyrus, Kirsten Dunst, Emma Roberts, Leighton Meester, Nicola Peltz, and Kim Basinger Anderson. His work has been featured in editorials for W Magazine, Vogue, Interview, ELLE, Harper's Bazaar, and LOVE Magazine.

Justin lives in Los Angeles and is currently a head colorist at Chris McMillan Salon.
