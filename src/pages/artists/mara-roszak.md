Growing up in the Laurel Canyon area of Los Angeles, Mara Roszak was exposed to a broad range of aesthetics. Mara's mother was a sculptor and encouraged her to explore all forms of visual art. At the young age of 15, Mara undertook her hairstyling education, and within two years she was working with some of the most celebrated talent in the entertainment industry. The expansion of her career into the editorial and advertising arena soon followed.

Mara gleans artistic inspiration from a variety of influences, and is motivated by bringing creative concepts to life. She has collaborated with renowned photographers including Mario Sorrenti, Craig McDean, JuergenÂ Teller, Norman Jean Roy and Tierney Gearon. Her work has been featured in editorials for W Magazine, Interview, ELLE, Harper's Bazaar and Self Service and in advertising campaigns for Dior, Gucci, Elizabeth Arden and Revlon. Mara's celebrity clients include Emma Stone, Brie Larson, Cara Delevingne, Carey Mulligan, Nicole Kidman, Elle Fanning and Zoe Saldana.

Mara lives in Los Angeles and is the owner of the Mare salon in West Hollywood.
