Sascha Breuer was born with a blow dryer in hand.  The son of two hairdressers, his early education equipped him with a unique perspective and the intuition of a seasoned stylist. At a young age, Sascha moved from his native Germany to London to develop his talent. This enthusiasm blossomed into a global career collaborating with leading photographers like Rankin, Peter Linbergh, Ben Hassett, and Simon Emmet on editorials for magazines such as Vogue, Numéro, Vanity Fair, Harper’s Bazaar and Another Magazine.

Sascha’s warm personality communicates his boundless creativity and passion for collaboration. His expertise in forecasting hair and color trends has made Sascha a valued consultant to top global beauty brands and sought-after hairdresser to an impressive list of celebrity clients including Anne Hathaway, Hilary Swank, Keira Knightley, Shailene Woodley, Naomi Campbell, and Victoria Ingrid Alice Désirée, Crown Princess of Sweden.

In 2014, Sascha was featured among Germany’s iconic hairdressers, fashion designers, creative directors and photographers in the Prestel publication “Fashion Germany,” a 200-page illustrated anthology edited by Martina Rink.
Sascha lives in Los Angeles.
